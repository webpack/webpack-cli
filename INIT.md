### Description of questions asked by the generator

1. `Will your application have multiple bundles? (y/N)`

> _Property/key resolved: [entry](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#entry)_

This is used to determine if your app will have multiple [entry points](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#entry).
If you want to have multiple entry points, answer yes. If you want to have only one, answer no.

2. `Which will be your application entry point? (src/index)`

> _Property/key resolved: [entry](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/entry-context/#entry)_

This tells webpack from which file to start bundling your application. The default answer `src/index` will tell webpack to look for a file called `index` inside a folder named `src`.

3. `In which folder do you want to store your generated bundles? (dist)`

> _Property/key resolved: [output.path](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-path)_

The output directory is where your bundled application will be. Your `index.html` will read the generated files from this folder, that is usually named `dist`.

4. `Will you be using ES2015? (Y/n)`

> _Property/key resolved: [module.rules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#module-rules) (for .js files)_

This enables webpack to parse [`ES2015`](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) code. Answer `Yes` if you want to use modern JavaScript in your project.

5. `Will you use one of the below CSS solutions?`

> _Property/key resolved: [module.rules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#module-rules) (for .scss,.less,.css,.postCSS files)_

If you use any sort of style in your project, such as [`.less`](http://lesscss.org/), [`.scss`](http://sass-lang.com/), [`.css`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) or [`postCSS`](http://postcss.org/) you will need to declare this here. If you don't use CSS, answer no.

6. `If you want to bundle your CSS files, what will you name the bundle? (press enter to skip)`

If you indicate based on previous questions that you are using production, this will be enabled. The default value for your generated CSS file is `style.[contentHash].css`, which will collect all your `.less`, `.scss` or `.css` into one file. This will make your build faster in production.
