# Webpack CLI

This project intends to be the main cli package of webpack. Here we will encapsulate all the features and code related to the command line. From sending options to the compiler, to initialize and migrate from version to version.

**Note** The package is still in work in progress. In case you want to contribute, reach to us, so we can point you out how and when you can help us.
