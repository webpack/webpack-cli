## Introduction

Webpack CLI provides the interface of options webpack uses in its configuration file. The CLI options override options passed in the configuration file.

The CLI provides a rich set of commands that helps you develop your application faster.

### How to install

If you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack then webpack CLI is already installed!

Otherwise `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli`, `yarn add webpack-cli --dev` or `pnpm add --D webpack-cli` will install it.

## Supported arguments and commands

Get to know what are the available commands and arguments [here](./packages/webpack-cli/README.md).

## Packages

We organize webpack CLI as a multi-package repository using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). The main CLI logic using options, resides in [`packages/webpack-cli`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/tree/master/packages/webpack-cli), while commands supported by the CLI, has dedicated subfolders in the folder [`packages`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/tree/master/packages).

A summary of supported commands is described below.

### Commands

Supporting developers is an important task for webpack CLI.
Thus, webpack CLI provides different commands for many common tasks.

- [`build|bundle|b [entries...] [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#build) - Run webpack (default command, can be omitted).
- [`configtest|t [config-path]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#configtest) - Validate a webpack configuration.
- [`help|h [command] [option]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#help) - Display help for commands and options.
- [`init|create|new|c|n [generation-path] [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#init) - Create a new webpack project.
- [`info|i [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#info) - Returns information related to the local environment.
- [`plugin|p [output-path] [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#plugin) - Initiate new plugin project.
- [`loader|l [output-path] [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#loader) - Initiate new loader project.
- [`serve|server|s [entries...] [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#serve) - Use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading.
- [`version|v [commands...]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#version) - Output the version number of `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, and commands.
- [`watch|w [entries...] [options]`](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#watch) - Run webpack and watch for files changes.

## Getting started

If you have followed the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) guide of webpack, then webpack CLI is already installed!

Otherwise, you would need to install webpack CLI and the packages you want to use.

If you want to create a fresh webpack project, the `init` command will guide you through setting up a project. Run the command as stated below.

```sh
npm i webpack-cli @webpack-cli/init
```

```sh
npx webpack-cli init
```

You will then be prompted for some questions about which features you want to use, such as `scss`, `typescript`, `PWA` support or other features.

## Exit codes and their meanings

| Exit Code | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | Success                                            |
| `1`       | Errors from webpack                                |
| `2`       | Configuration/options problem or an internal error |
