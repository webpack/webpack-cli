# Webpack CLI

Webpack CLI encapsulates all code related to CLI handling. It captures options and sends them to webpack compiler. You can also find functionality for initializing a project and migrating between versions. For the time being, it is backwards-compatible with the CLI included in webpack itself.

## Migration from webpack v1 to v2

The `migrate` feature eases the transition from [version 1](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) to [version 2](https://gist.github.com/sokra/27b24881210b56bbaff7). `migrate` also allows users to switch to the new version of webpack without having to extensively [refactor](https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/).

`webpack-cli migrate <config>`

[Read more about migrating](MIGRATE.md)

## Creating new webpack projects

The `init` feature allows users to get started with webpack, fast. Through scaffolding, people can create their own configuration in order to faster initialize new projects for various of use cases.

`webpack-cli init webpack-addons-<package>`

[Read more about scaffolding](SCAFFOLDING.md)
